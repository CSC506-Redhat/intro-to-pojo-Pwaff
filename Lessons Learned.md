#Lessons Learned from Intro to Pojo
The intro to pojo repo is an introductory eye-opener to the power of Git and GitHub and how important these tools are in the software development ecosystem.

These are what I learnt

##GitHub
I added knowledge on GitHub, realizing that it is a UI version of Git.

##Forking a Repo
forking a repo (normally done when contributing to another person's project) creates a new version of the repo on your GitHub profile.

##Cloning a Repo
When you clone, you create a local version of the repo to your machine, which you cn use to make changes.

##Creating a Branch
Creeating a branch allows you to make changes in isolation from the main codebase to avoid interferace with the stable codebase.

##Commit and Push
You make a commit to record the changes made to repo to the staging area normall with an -m flag to write a custom commit message

##Push
Pushing uploads the repo branch and it's commit to the remote repo on GitHub

##PR
A pull request(PR) is a request made to merge changes from the branch (in a fork) to the original repo's branch.
